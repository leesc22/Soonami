# Soonami App
This app displays information about a single earthquake event and whether or not there was a tsunami alert issued for it. Used in a Udacity course in the Android Basics Nanodegree.

The data is retrieved from the USGS service. https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/

The repo is originally in [Java](https://github.com/udacity/ud843_Soonami) used in Udacity course.
This repo is an exercise for me to migrate it to Kotlin.
